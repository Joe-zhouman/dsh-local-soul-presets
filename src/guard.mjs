/**
 * The trust rule for this plugin's own routes.
 *
 * The shared `webServer` applies no authentication of its own: the process
 * token and `dsh-auth-*` cookie fence lives in the browser-auth layer, which
 * covers `GET /` and the `/api` channel only. A plugin route is therefore
 * outside the fence and must decide for itself.
 *
 * The deciding check is the Host header, not `Sec-Fetch-Site`: under DNS
 * rebinding the attacker's page resolves to a loopback address, so the browser
 * reports a same-origin request and that header arrives normally. This mirrors
 * the rule the harness uses for `/api` (client-connection's isTrustedApiRequest)
 * with its non-loopback authority branch dropped — this deployment binds
 * loopback only, and no seam exposes a trusted-host list to a plugin.
 * @module dsh-local-soul-presets/src/guard
